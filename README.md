# Changes in this repo fork

* Shift/ctrl + up/down/left right move the upper-left and lower-right borders of a selected
  rectangle.

* The save action is enabled by default (so we can save images with no boxes)

* Shortcut to copy the current file to the clipboard (useful for re-starting where you left off when you've prepopulated the list, so the checkboxes aren't useuful)

* Allow saving annotations to the output_dir when output_dir is specified (I don't really remember why I did this) 

* Keyboard shortcut to select all polygons
